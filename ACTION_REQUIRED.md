# 🛑 ACTION REQUIRED: Database is Offline

The deployment is **BLOCKED** because the database is not accessible.

## The Problem
The Supabase project `gvybvfbnqgzcisuchocz` cannot be found.
- **Hostname**: `db.gvybvfbnqgzcisuchocz.supabase.co`
- **Error**: `NXDOMAIN` (Domain not found)

## Why is this happening?
1. **Paused Project**: Supabase pauses free projects after 7 days of inactivity.
2. **Deleted Project**: The project might have been deleted.

## ⚡️ HOW TO FIX IT (You must do this)

1. **Login to Supabase**: Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. **Find the Project**: Look for the project with ID `gvybvfbnqgzcisuchocz` (or "JoBika_PERN").
3. **Restore Project**:
   - If it says "Paused", click the **Restore** button.
   - Wait a few minutes for it to come back online.
4. **Verify**:
   - Once restored, tell me "I have restored the database".

## If the project is DELETED:
1. Create a NEW Supabase project.
2. Get the new **Connection String**.
3. Paste it here so I can update the configuration.

**I cannot finish the deployment until the database is online.**
